## 💡 Key Principles to Remember

### 1. **Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash**
BSV maintains Bitcoin's original vision as described in the whitepaper - a peer-to-peer electronic cash system that scales globally.

### 2. **Stable Protocol**
Unlike other blockchains, BSV's protocol is locked, providing a stable foundation for long-term development.

### 3. **Unbounded Scaling**
No artificial limits on block size or transaction throughput - the system scales with demand.

### 4. **Economic Incentives**
Miners are incentivized by transaction fees, not block subsidies, ensuring long-term sustainability.

### 5. **Legal Compliance**
Designed to work within existing legal frameworks, not to circumvent them.

## 📊 Foundation Concepts Overview
