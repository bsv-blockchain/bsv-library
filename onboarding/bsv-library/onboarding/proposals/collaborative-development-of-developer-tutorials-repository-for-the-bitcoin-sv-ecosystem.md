# Collaborative Development of Developer Tutorials Repository for the Bitcoin SV Ecosystem

Plan Overview: The objective of this plan is to create a collaborative environment for the development of a comprehensive repository of developer tutorials that extend the documentation for the Bitcoin SV ecosystem. By leveraging the collective expertise and knowledge of the community, we aim to build a valuable resource for developers and users that supports the development of innovative applications and services on the Bitcoin SV blockchain.

1. Repository and Submission/Request Policy

* Set up a GitHub repository dedicated to the development of developer tutorials.
* Develop a submission and request policy that outlines the required format for submitting new tutorials or requesting specific tutorials. The policy should include guidelines for tutorial structure, content, and coding examples.
* Add the policy to the repository README file for easy reference by contributors.

2. Encourage Tutorial Requests and Submissions

* Invite the Bitcoin SV community to submit tutorial proposals by raising issues on the GitHub repository.
* Encourage developers to request tutorials on specific topics or features that they would like to learn more about.
* Promote the repository and submission/request policy through relevant communication channels, such as community forums, social media, and newsletters.

3. Review and Development Process

* Set up a review team consisting of experienced developers and community members to evaluate tutorial submissions and requests.
* Use GitHub Projects and workflow integrations to track the status of tutorial submissions and requests, including the review process, tutorial development, and final approval.
* For submitted tutorials, the review team will evaluate their quality, relevance, and adherence to the submission policy. Approved tutorials will be added to the repository.
* For requested tutorials, the review team will assess the demand and importance of the topic. High-priority requests can be put out for incentivized tender, where developers can submit proposals to create the requested tutorial and receive a bounty upon successful completion.

4. Incentivizing and Recognizing Contributions

* Implement a bounty program to incentivize developers to create high-quality tutorials. Bounties can be awarded based on the complexity and importance of the requested tutorial.
* Recognize and showcase top contributors in the repository README file, on the project website, and through community channels to encourage further participation.

5. Repository Maintenance and Expansion

* Regularly update and maintain the repository to ensure the tutorials remain relevant and accurate.
* Continuously promote the repository and encourage new tutorial submissions and requests, fostering ongoing community involvement.
* Explore opportunities for collaboration with other projects, organizations, or events to expand the repository's reach and impact.

6. Evaluation and Feedback

* Periodically evaluate the progress and impact of the collaborative tutorial development project, assessing the growth of the repository, community engagement, and the overall quality of the tutorials.
* Seek feedback from the community and adjust the project plan as needed to improve the process and outcomes.

By implementing this plan, we aim to create a collaborative and dynamic environment for the development of a valuable resource of developer tutorials for the Bitcoin SV ecosystem. This repository will not only provide a comprehensive learning platform for developers but also foster a sense of community and knowledge-sharing within the Bitcoin SV space. As the repository grows and evolves, it will contribute to the ongoing development and standardization of the Bitcoin SV ecosystem, paving the way for innovative and transformative blockchain-based applications.
