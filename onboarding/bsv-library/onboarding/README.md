# 01. Introduction

Welcome to this guide on getting started with BitcoinSV (BSV) and implementing an invoice-based payment workflow. BitcoinSV is the original implementation of the Bitcoin protocol, staying true to its design principles by upholding the vision of peer-to-peer electronic cash. It is important to note that BSV is not a fork of Bitcoin, but rather a continuation of the original concept. The Bitcoin Association protects the copyright for the database and whitepaper, ensuring that the integrity of the project is maintained.

BitcoinSV emphasizes the importance of secure and efficient transactions, making it an ideal choice for a wide range of applications. One of the key strengths of BitcoinSV is its ability to scale massively, with the potential to handle millions of transactions per second. This scalability ensures that the network can accommodate global demand and foster widespread adoption.

In this guide, we will introduce an invoice-based payment workflow that streamlines the transaction process between parties. This approach enhances the user experience, promotes security, and ensures transaction efficiency. Furthermore, we will explore the extensibility of this workflow, highlighting potential improvements and advanced features that can be integrated as they become available.

By the end of this guide, you will have a solid understanding of the BitcoinSV protocol and the invoice-based payment workflow, along with insights into the potential of this approach to shape the future of digital transactions.
