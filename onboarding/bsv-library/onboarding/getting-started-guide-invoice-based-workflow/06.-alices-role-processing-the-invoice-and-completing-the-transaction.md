# 06. Alice's Role: Processing the Invoice and Completing the Transaction

a. Decoding the Invoice Data

Once Alice receives the invoice, she needs to decode the data to extract the payment information, including the recipient address (which could be an IP2IP address or Paymail address), amount, and any additional payment details.

b. Selecting UTXOs to Cover the Invoice Amount

Alice's wallet software will select the appropriate unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) to cover the invoice amount, taking into account factors such as transaction fees and UTXO age.

c. Calculating the Transaction Fee

The wallet software will also calculate the appropriate transaction fee based on the current network conditions and user preferences.

d. Creating the Transaction

i. Specifying Input UTXOs

Alice's wallet software will specify the selected UTXOs as inputs for the transaction.

ii. Specifying Output Addresses (Recipient and Change)

The wallet software will specify the recipient address from the decoded invoice data (which could be an IP2IP address or Paymail address) as the output address for the payment. It will also generate a change address, if necessary, to return any remaining funds to Alice.

iii. Setting the Transaction Fee

f. Extending the Transaction Preparation Process for Additional Features

The transaction preparation process can be extended to support additional features, such as multi-signature transactions, time-locked transactions, and other advanced transaction types. This may require additional steps or modifications to the transaction creation and signing process.

g. Sharing the Signed Transaction with Bob

After Alice has signed the transaction, she needs to share the signed transaction with Bob. This can be done through various methods, such as WLAN, Bluetooth, NFC, or by scanning a QR code displayed on a point-of-sale (POS) device. The method chosen should provide a secure and convenient way for Alice to share the transaction data with Bob, who will then broadcast it to the Bitcoin network.

By following these steps, Alice can process the invoice, create and sign the transaction, and share the signed transaction with Bob. The use of IP2IP payments and Paymail addresses can enhance the user experience and streamline the payment process while maintaining a high level of security and privacy.
