# 12. ZMQ and LibreCast

ZMQ and Librecast can be particularly useful in the following steps of the invoice-based payment workflow for BitcoinSV transactions:

1. Invoice exchange (Step 1): In this step, Alice generates an invoice containing the payment details and sends it to Bob. Utilizing ZMQ or Librecast as messaging services can facilitate a secure and efficient exchange of invoices between the parties, ensuring that payment details are accurately transmitted and received.
2. Transaction broadcasting (Step 3c): Once Bob has received the signed transaction from Alice and verified its signature, he needs to broadcast the transaction to the mining nodes. ZMQ and Librecast can be employed to create multicast groups, enabling efficient broadcasting of the transaction to multiple nodes simultaneously. This approach reduces network overhead and improves the overall transaction processing time.
3. Transaction status monitoring (Step 4): After the transaction has been broadcast, it is essential to monitor its status in the Bitcoin network. ZMQ and Librecast can be utilized to create pub-sub models for multicast groups, allowing the involved parties and the ARC service to receive real-time updates on the transaction's progress. This enables efficient handling of transaction confirmations, rejections, or failures, and ensures timely notifications of successful transaction completion.

By incorporating ZMQ and Librecast into these steps of the workflow, the overall efficiency, security, and scalability of the invoice-based payment process for BitcoinSV transactions can be significantly enhanced.
