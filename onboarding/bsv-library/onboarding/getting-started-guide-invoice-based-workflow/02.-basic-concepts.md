# 02. Basic Concepts

Before delving into the invoice-based payment workflow, it is essential to understand some fundamental concepts related to BitcoinSV and the underlying protocol.

a. Public and private key pairs: In the BitcoinSV ecosystem, users are identified by public-private key pairs. The private key is kept secret, while the public key can be shared openly. These keys facilitate secure transactions and digital signatures.

b. The secp256k1 elliptic curve: BitcoinSV employs the secp256k1 elliptic curve for key pair generation, ensuring strong cryptographic security.

c. Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs): At the core of the BitcoinSV protocol are UTXOs, which represent transaction outputs that have not been spent. UTXOs are atomic instantiations, similar to instantiated objects in object-oriented programming. Even if two objects are instantiated with the same information, they are separate entities, as they were instantiated at different times and are part of separate transactions with different transaction IDs (TXIDs). This is what makes Bitcoin peer-to-peer electronic cash, as each UTXO can be handled individually, in contrast to account-based systems.

It's crucial to understand that the BitcoinSV protocol is built upon UTXOs. This design choice provides a robust solution to the double-spend problem, as all network nodes are aware of all transactions and will reject any new transaction attempting to spend a UTXO that has already been spent. The chain of Inputs to Outputs and the fact that Outputs can only be spent once ensure that double-spends are mitigated, as long as nodes are aware of transactional activity on the network. Nodes only need to verify a spent transaction once, after which they no longer need to care.

In contrast, account-based blockchain systems like Ethereum require nodes to arbitrate network transactional activity and perform work on each transaction received, as they cannot verify account balances without determining the account balances for all accounts on the network. This approach becomes increasingly untenable as network throughput grows.

d. Change addresses: BitcoinSV transactions often involve change addresses. When a transaction is executed, the difference between the input UTXO and the desired output is sent back to the sender as "change" through a change address. This process enhances privacy and security.

e. Transaction signing: To authorize a transaction, the initiator must sign it using their private key. This digital signature demonstrates that the transaction is legitimate and authorized by the sender.

The UTXO model separates identity from transactions, effectively protecting sensitive personal information during digital interactions. Instead of exposing all personal information like in an account-based model, the UTXO model only exposes the necessary information for the transaction. This approach decentralizes data ownership, giving users greater control over their own information.

In the UTXO model, user security is realized in two ways:

1. Users no longer have accounts, so they no longer need passwords.
2. Users store and maintain their data, ensuring that there are no large contiguous sets of user data that hackers can access (this is automated via wallets).

In summary, understanding these basic concepts will provide a strong foundation for implementing an invoice-based payment workflow in BitcoinSV. By leveraging the unique properties of the UTXO model, developers can create secure, privacy-oriented, and scalable applications that empower users and foster widespread adoption of digital currencies.
