# 08. Using ARC to Verify UTXO Double-Spend Status

Bob can utilize the ARC transaction processor to verify that the UTXOs committed to the transaction by Alice haven't been double spent. This process can be added after Bob performs the Merkle proof verification using his locally held headers.

1. Preparing UTXO Data for ARC

Bob needs to extract the UTXO data from the Extended Format transaction provided by Alice.

a. Extracting UTXO Data

Extract the UTXO data from the Extended Format transaction, including the transaction IDs and output indexes associated with each input in the transaction.

2. Sending UTXO Data to ARC

Bob will send the extracted UTXO data to the ARC API for double-spend verification.

a. Preparing ARC API Request

Prepare the ARC API request, which includes authentication, the extracted UTXO data, and an optional callback URL if Bob wishes to receive a callback notification when the transaction is accepted by the Bitcoin network.

b. Sending the ARC API Request

Send the prepared ARC API request to the designated ARC instance, which will then process the request and verify the UTXO double-spend status.

3. Processing ARC API Response

Bob's wallet software should process the response received from the ARC API to determine whether any of the UTXOs have already been spent.

a. Checking for Double-Spend Status

Parse the ARC API response and check for any indications that one or more UTXOs have been double spent.

b. Handling Double-Spend Indications

If any UTXOs have been double spent, Bob's wallet software should notify Bob and take the appropriate action, such as refusing the transaction or requesting further information from Alice.

By using ARC to verify the UTXO double-spend status, Bob can add an extra layer of security and confidence to the transaction process. This method complements the Merkle proof verification by ensuring that the UTXOs provided by Alice are not only valid but also unspent, preventing potential double-spend attempts.
