# 13. Nx NRWL Mono Repo

The invoice-based payment workflow can be integrated into an nx nrwl mono repo application, allowing users to generate invoices for payments, create tipping buttons, and interact with other profiles on the app. Here's a high-level overview of how this can be achieved:

1. Application architecture: The nx nrwl mono repo structure allows you to organize your application into multiple libraries and apps that share common code. You can create separate libraries for handling BitcoinSV transactions, invoice generation, tipping buttons, paymail integration, and user profiles. This modular approach ensures maintainability and scalability.
2. Invoice generation: Users can generate invoices through a dedicated library in the mono repo. This library can include functionality for creating invoices with necessary transaction details and exporting the invoice in a standard format (e.g., BIP70) that can be easily shared or embedded on the user's profile.
3. Tipping buttons: Another library can be created specifically for handling tipping functionality. Users can create customizable tipping buttons that utilize various sighash schemes to enable different payment scenarios. These buttons can be embedded on user profiles, allowing visitors to send tips directly by interacting with the button.
4. Paymail integration: To enhance interoperability with other apps and wallets, you can integrate paymail into your application. Paymail allows users to send and receive payments using simple, human-readable addresses, making transactions more user-friendly. By supporting paymail, your application can interact seamlessly with other paymail-enabled services, wallets, and apps.
5. User profiles and interactions: Leveraging the libraries for handling transactions, invoices, and tipping, user profiles can be designed to display the relevant payment options, such as invoice QR codes or tipping buttons. Visitors can easily engage with these payment options, streamlining the payment process and promoting peer-to-peer transactions.

In summary, implementing the invoice-based payment workflow in an nx nrwl mono repo application provides a robust, modular, and scalable solution for managing BitcoinSV transactions, invoice generation, tipping functionality, and paymail integration. This approach enhances user experience and promotes interoperability with other services and wallets, facilitating seamless transactions and interactions between users and their profiles within the app and beyond.
