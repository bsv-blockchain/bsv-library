# 03. Setting up a Development Environement

To build an invoice-based payment workflow using BitcoinSV, it's important to set up a proper development environment. This section will guide you through the process of configuring a suitable workspace, taking into consideration the unique requirements of light clients and the BitcoinSV ecosystem.

a. Choose your platform: Start by selecting the development platform most suitable for your project. You can choose from various operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux. The choice depends on your team's preferences, existing tools, and infrastructure compatibility.

b. Install essential tools: Regardless of the platform, you will need to install some fundamental software tools, such as a code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Atom), a version control system (e.g., Git), and the appropriate programming language compilers or interpreters (e.g., Python, JavaScript, or C++).

c. Set up the light client infrastructure: As mentioned earlier, using a light client setup is beneficial for businesses and developers looking to minimize infrastructure requirements and enhance scalability. Light clients can either run the SPV infrastructure themselves or connect to service providers who manage it on their behalf. Some components of the light client infrastructure include:

* Block Headers client
* Wallet with key management and transaction signing capabilities
* Transaction manager for creating and building custom transaction scripts
* Transaction broadcaster to nodes
* Merkle proof retriever and storage
* SPV process validator
* Signature and script validator

d. Choose your wallet: Select a BitcoinSV-compatible wallet that meets your project's needs. Consider factors such as the wallet's security, user experience, backup and storage options, and key management features. You may also want to evaluate its support for Paymail, an email-like addressing system that simplifies public key usage.\

d. Custom Wallets and Key Management Software

A wallet in the context of blockchain and cryptocurrencies is essentially a key management software. It handles the creation, storage, and management of public-private key pairs, and has internal logic for creating specific transaction types. In some cases, a bespoke key management software tailored to the requirements of a specific application can be useful, especially when dealing with unique transaction types or custom implementations.

To create a bespoke key management software, you can start by:

1. Deriving key pairs: Implement a solution to derive key pairs using the secp256k1 elliptic curve. As mentioned earlier, there are libraries and packages available for various programming languages to work with secp256k1.
2. Constructing transactions: Design logic to construct transactions as serialized data from the specific fields of a standardized transaction and extended format transactions, as documented in BIP239.

BIP239 proposes an Extended Format (EF) for Bitcoin transactions that include the locking script and the amount in satoshis of all inputs of the transaction. This allows a broadcast service to validate all aspects of a transaction without having to contact a node or an indexer for the utxos of the inputs of a transaction, thus speeding up the validation process and improving scalability.

To implement BIP239 in your bespoke key management software, consider the following steps:

i. Serialize transactions in the Extended Format: When creating a new transaction, serialize it using the Extended Format instead of the standard format. This will include the missing data (previous locking scripts and satoshi outputs) from the utxos being used in the transaction. Since this data is available at the time of transaction creation, there is no additional work involved in serializing the transaction in Extended Format.

ii. Implement validation logic: Design logic that allows a broadcast service to validate transactions without contacting an external service for missing data. This will enable the service to become more scalable and efficient in processing transactions.\
\
iii. Incorporate BIP239 into your bespoke wallet: Integrate BIP239's Extended Format and validation logic into your custom wallet or key management software to enhance the efficiency and scalability of your application's transactions.

e. Set up a blockchain API provider: To interact with the BitcoinSV blockchain, consider using an API provider that offers services such as UTXO management, transaction broadcasting, and data retrieval. Many nodes offer API endpoints for these purposes, with some also providing Block Explorer functionality for reading and analyzing blockchain data.

f. Install the LiteClient toolbox: The Bitcoin Association provides a reference implementation called LiteClient that includes most of the components required for light client infrastructure. This toolbox comprises:

* A simple web wallet
* Block headers client
* Transaction builder and broadcaster
* mAPI (component to interact with node RPC endpoint to receive broadcasted transactions)
* Paymail support
* A library for SPV processes and wallet functions

More information on the LiteClient toolbox can be found at [https://docs.bitcoinsv.io/introduction/liteclient-toolbox](https://docs.bitcoinsv.io/introduction/liteclient-toolbox).

g. Set up a development environment for secp256k1: To generate public-private key pairs using the secp256k1 elliptic curve, you'll need a suitable development environment. Many programming languages have libraries and packages for working with secp256k1, such as bitcoinjs-lib for JavaScript, pycoin for Python, and bitcoin-ruby for Ruby.

h. Testnet setup: Before deploying your application on the main BitcoinSV network, it's crucial to test your implementation on a testnet. Testnets are separate networks that function similarly to the main network but use a different blockchain and coins without any real-world value. This allows developers to test their applications without risking actual funds. Be sure to configure your wallet and API provider to work with the testnet during the development and testing phases.

i. Deploy your application: Once you've thoroughly tested your application on the testnet, you can deploy it on the main BitcoinSV network. Be prepared to monitor and maintain your application, fix bugs, and address any security or performance issues that arise.
