# 07. Extended Transaction Format, Standardised Merkle Proof  and Direct Communication



In this section, we'll outline the steps Alice can take to include the values necessary for the Extended Format (EF) as proposed in BIP 239 and the standardized Merkle proof data, facilitating a more performant workflow using direct communication between Alice and Bob.

1. Including Extended Format Data

To include the Extended Format data in the transaction, Alice needs to gather and serialize the locking script and amount in satoshis of all inputs of the transaction. The following steps can be added to Alice's transaction preparation process:

a. Gathering Input Data

For each input in the transaction, Alice's wallet software should gather the locking script and the amount in satoshis associated with the input UTXO.

b. Serializing the Extended Format Data

Serialize the transaction in the Extended Format, which includes the locking script and amount in satoshis of all inputs in addition to the standard transaction data.

2. Providing Merkle Proof Data

To provide the standardized Merkle proof data, Alice needs to gather the required data and package it in a standard format. The following steps can be added to Alice's transaction preparation process:

a. Obtaining the Merkle Proof

For the transaction Alice is creating, obtain the Merkle proof from a Bitcoin node or a third-party service.

b. Formatting the Merkle Proof Data

Format the Merkle proof data in a standardized format, including the transaction being proven, the Merkle root of the tree, a list of pairs \[p\[0], ... , p\[n]] to the calculated nodes, and the information about whether each pair is a left or right-hand node.

3. Sharing the Extended Format and Merkle Proof Data with Bob Using Direct Communication

Once Alice has prepared the Extended Format transaction data and the standardized Merkle proof data, she needs to share this information with Bob or the recipient using direct communication methods, such as WLAN, Bluetooth, NFC, or even a POS device using the DNS resolution of a Paymail host.

a. Preparing the Data Envelope

Package the Extended Format transaction and Merkle proof data in a standardized data envelope that can be easily processed by Bob's wallet software.

b. Sending the Data Envelope to Bob

Alice can send the data envelope to Bob using the chosen direct communication method, such as WLAN, Bluetooth, NFC, or a POS device with Paymail support.

c. Bob Performs Merkle Proof Verification

Once Bob receives the data envelope, his wallet software can perform the Merkle proof against his locally held headers maintained by the header client in the lite client toolbox.

By including the Extended Format and Merkle proof data in the transaction and utilizing direct communication between Alice and Bob, the need for additional lookups is eliminated, improving overall performance and user experience. This more efficient and scalable validation process ensures that all necessary data is available for complete validation without the need for external services.
