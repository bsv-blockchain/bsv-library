# 09. Bob's Role: Finalising and Broadcasting the Transaction

In this process, Bob will finalize and broadcast the transaction using the ARC service, which is connected to a multicast group containing Alice, Bob, and the ARC service itself. This setup allows for extreme scalability, as there is no lookup required with the provision of the Merkle proof and Extended Format.

a. Receiving the signed transaction from Alice

Bob's software should be able to receive the signed transaction from Alice via a direct communication channel (e.g., WLAN, Bluetooth, NFC, or DNS resolution of a Paymail host).

```javascript
javascriptCopy code// Code snippet for receiving the signed transaction from Alice
function receiveSignedTransaction() {
  // Implementation for receiving the signed transaction
}
```

b. Verifying the transaction signature

Before broadcasting the transaction, Bob should verify the transaction signatures to ensure they are valid.

```javascript
javascriptCopy code// Code snippet for verifying the transaction signature
function verifyTransactionSignature(signedTransaction) {
  // Implementation for verifying the transaction signature
}
```

c. Broadcasting the transaction to the mining nodes

Once the transaction signatures have been verified, Bob can broadcast the transaction using the ARC service.

```javascript
javascriptCopy code// Code snippet for broadcasting the transaction to the mining nodes
function broadcastTransaction(signedTransaction) {
  // Implementation for broadcasting the transaction to the mining nodes
}
```

d. Extending the transaction finalization process for additional security measures

Bob's software can implement additional security measures to enhance the transaction finalization process. For example, Bob can request Alice to provide proof of work for the transaction, or implement a time lock mechanism to delay the transaction broadcast.

```javascript
javascriptCopy code// Extension documentation for additional security measures
```

Monitoring the transaction status

Bob's software should monitor the transaction status as it progresses through the Bitcoin network, with the help of the ARC service.

a. Confirmations and block inclusion

ARC can provide information about the transaction confirmations and block inclusion. Bob's software should listen for these events and update the transaction status accordingly.

```javascript
javascriptCopy code// Code snippet for listening to confirmations and block inclusion
function onTransactionConfirmation(transactionId, blockHeight) {
  // Implementation for handling transaction confirmations and block inclusion
}
```

b. Handling transaction rejections or failures

ARC can also notify Bob's software if the transaction is rejected or fails for any reason. In this case, Bob should take appropriate actions, such as retrying the transaction or notifying Alice.

```javascript
javascriptCopy code// Code snippet for handling transaction rejections or failures
function onTransactionRejected(transactionId, reason) {
  // Implementation for handling transaction rejections or failures
}
```

c. Successful transaction confirmation

Once the transaction is successfully confirmed, Bob's software should update its internal records and notify Bob of the transaction's completion.

```javascript
javascriptCopy code// Code snippet for handling successful transaction confirmation
function onTransactionSuccess(transactionId) {
  // Implementation for handling successful transaction confirmation
}
```

The multicast group setup with Alice, Bob, and the ARC service streamlines the transaction process, enabling real-time updates without requiring lookups. This approach allows for extreme scalability, as the Merkle proof and Extended Format alleviate the need for complex verification processes. By employing this method, Bob can efficiently finalize and broadcast transactions, monitor their progress, and handle any issues that may arise, all while maintaining a highly scalable system.
