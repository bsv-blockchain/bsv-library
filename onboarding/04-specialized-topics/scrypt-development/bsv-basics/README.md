# BSV Basics for Smart Contract Development

## 📚 Building Your Foundation

If you're new to BSV development, this section will help you understand the essential concepts needed for writing smart contracts. While not strictly required, understanding these fundamentals will make your sCrypt journey much smoother.

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

This section covers the key BSV concepts that directly relate to smart contract development:

1. **Keys and Addresses** - The foundation of BSV identity
2. **Transactions and UTXOs** - How value moves on BSV
3. **Scripts and Signatures** - The building blocks of smart contracts
4. **BSV Tools and Utilities** - Practical tools for development

## 📖 Chapter Overview

### [1. The BSV Submodule](./bsv-submodule.md)
Learn about sCrypt's powerful BSV utilities that handle low-level blockchain operations:
- Key generation and management
- Address creation and formats
- Transaction construction
- Cryptographic functions

### [2. Keys and Addresses](./keys-and-addresses.md)
Deep dive into BSV's cryptographic foundation:
- Private keys and their security
- Public key derivation
- Address types and uses
- Best practices for key management

### [3. Understanding UTXOs](./understanding-utxos.md)
Master the UTXO model that powers BSV:
- What UTXOs are and how they work
- Transaction inputs and outputs
- The spending model
- Chain of ownership

### [4. Scripts and Smart Contracts](./scripts-and-contracts.md)
Connect BSV Script to sCrypt development:
- Lock scripts vs unlock scripts
- How sCrypt compiles to Script
- Common script patterns
- Smart contract execution flow

## 🚀 Quick Start Path

If you're eager to start coding, here's the minimum you need to know:

### 1. **BSV Uses UTXOs, Not Accounts**
```
Traditional Banking: Account has balance
BSV: Coins exist as separate UTXOs (like bills in your wallet)
```

### 2. **Smart Contracts Lock Coins**
```typescript
// Your sCrypt code creates locking conditions
@method()
public unlock(solution: bigint) {
    // This becomes a lock script that protects coins
    assert(solution == 42n, 'Wrong answer!')
}
```

### 3. **Transactions Spend and Create UTXOs**
```
Transaction Flow:
Inputs (spend existing UTXOs) → Processing → Outputs (create new UTXOs)
```

### 4. **Keys Control Regular Payments**
```
Private Key → Public Key → BSV Address
(Keep secret)  (Share OK)   (Receive payments)
```

## 📚 Recommended Learning Path

### For Complete Beginners (2-3 hours)
1. Read [Understanding UTXOs](./understanding-utxos.md)
2. Review [Keys and Addresses](./keys-and-addresses.md)
3. Explore [The BSV Submodule](./bsv-submodule.md)
4. Practice with code examples

### For Developers New to Blockchain (1-2 hours)
1. Start with [Scripts and Smart Contracts](./scripts-and-contracts.md)
2. Review [The BSV Submodule](./bsv-submodule.md)
3. Jump to [Writing Your First Contract](../writing-contracts/basics.md)

### For Blockchain Developers (30 minutes)
1. Skim [The BSV Submodule](./bsv-submodule.md) for sCrypt specifics
2. Review BSV's restored opcodes and capabilities
3. Move directly to [Writing Contracts](../writing-contracts/README.md)

## 💡 Key Concepts to Remember

### 1. **BSV is Different**
BSV restored the original Bitcoin protocol, enabling:
- Unlimited script size
- All original opcodes
- Massive scaling
- True peer-to-peer transactions

### 2. **Smart Contracts are Scripts**
- Not accounts with code (like Ethereum)
- Scripts that lock transaction outputs
- Deterministic execution
- No global state

### 3. **Everything is a Transaction**
- Payments, data storage, smart contracts
- All use the same transaction structure
- All follow the same validation rules

### 4. **Simplicity is Power**
- Simple concepts combine for complex applications
- UTXO model enables parallelization
- Script enables any computable function

## ❓ Common Questions

### "Do I need to understand Bitcoin Script?"
Not initially! sCrypt abstracts the complexity. However, understanding the basics helps with debugging and optimization.

### "How is this different from Ethereum?"
- **UTXO vs Account model** - Coins vs balances
- **Stateless vs Stateful** - Each UTXO is independent
- **Script vs EVM** - Stack-based vs register-based
- **Scaling approach** - On-chain vs Layer 2

### "What makes BSV special?"
- **Unbounded scaling** - No artificial limits
- **Original opcodes** - Full scripting capability
- **Stable protocol** - Build with confidence
- **Low fees** - Micropayments are practical

## ✅ Ready to Continue?

Once you understand these basics:

1. **[Install sCrypt](../installation.md)** if you haven't already
2. **[Write Your First Contract](../writing-contracts/basics.md)** 
3. **[Deploy to BSV](../deployment/README.md)**

Remember: You don't need to master everything before starting. Learn by building!
